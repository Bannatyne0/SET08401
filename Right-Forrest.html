		<p style="text-align:center;margin:40px 30px;font-size:100%"> You've chosen the woods, fair enough. It's incredibly dark as you venture further in. Dark,
		lonely and scary. You push on though as going back would mean possibly scaling that mountain!
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;font-size:95%;margin:40px 30px">You have met someone along the way, they offer to support you through the woods,
		they've done this before and you feel like they are trustworthy. Do you accept their support or decline and keep walking on your own?</p>
