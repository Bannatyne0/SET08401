		<p style="text-align:center;margin:40px 30px;font-size:100%">In a world full of conflict and despair many people question this game of life.
		But your situation isn't exactly unique, around 117 Billion of us humans have played the game of life, some of which have asked themselves
		the same questions you have. Some of which struggled to find the purpose of it all. That's a rather terrifying thought.
		Although life, actually, is pretty unique. The chances of you being here, right now, reading this
		are low. In fact, the proability of you just existing is around one in ten (followed by two million six-hundred and eighty five 
		thousand zeroes). 
		I'd say that's pretty absurd and you may be inclined to feel the same way too. Nevertheless, being aware of these odds still doesn't 
		really answer the true question of meaning. And it doesn't have to. The odds of you being here don't prove anything other than how 
		absurd it is. But what if that is the meaning? To take note of the absurd and find meaning in it. To embrace the absurdity that
		surrounds you and accept it for how unfathomable it truly is. To feel things. To embrace failure, feeling uncomfortable, challenging 
		yourself, doubt it all and question why you ever done it in the first place only to do it all over again. Embrace love, and heartbreak, 
		embrace loss but also discovery. Embrace life. Why? I don't know. But you wouldn't be here reading this now if there wasn't something
		worth living for.

		<p style="text-align:center;font-size:95%;margin:40px 30px">Cool, so now you know everything about life. Therefore you'll know which path is the best option for you?. Sorry to burst your bubble but
		unless you've played this before, or have inspect element turned on via your web browser, you won't know which path is right for you. FYI, 
		Real-life doesn't have an inspect button like your web browser does! Anyway, go ahead you take it from here. </p>
